# Introduction

Welcome!

This documentation will guide you through the steps of setting up any one of our [Customizations](https://github.com/WybeNetwork/VistaPanel-Customizations) on your vPanel. Our Customizations include a theme switcher, making domain search responsive, changing the footer's logo and several more.

## What is vPanel?

vPanel (VistaPanel) is a control panel designed by iFastNet for their free hosting servers (MyOwnFreeHost). It allows free hosting clients to control and manage their website easily.

<!--## Examples

We will soon make a demo link for our vPanel customizations.-->

## Community
The developers, as well as people using the Customisations can be found hanging out in the [iFastNet Community Discord](https://discord.gg/zArW8kC), which is operated by Wybe Network members.
