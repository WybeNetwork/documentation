# Requirements

This page will guide you through the necessary requirements for installing VistaPanel Customizations.

## Account Requirements

In order to use VistaPanel Customizations, you are required to have a free reseller account with [MyOwnFreeHost (MOFH)](https://myownfreehost.net/createreseller.php?ref=WybeNetwork).

If you face any difficulties you can follow this tutorial: [How to Get Free Reseller Hosting? - AAVIDTutorials](https://aavidtutorials.com/mofh/how-to-get-free-reseller-hosting/?ref=WybeNetwork). It was made with the older version of MOFH's website, but the steps are the same.

## Requirements for CDN Installation

There are no additional requirements for installation through our CDN.

## Requirements for Manual Installation

To install VistaPanel Customizations manually, you will need to have a (sub)domain and a web hosting where you can host the scripts.

You can get a free domain from Freenom, as shown in the tutorial above, or a free subdomain from [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org), but you will need a separate web hosting or a place to host the scripts, MyOwnFreeHost's free hosting will not work.
