# Introduction

Welcome to a Documentation to guide you through the steps of setting up any one of our [VistaPanel Themes](https://github.com/WybeNetwork/VistaPanel-Themes) on your vPanel. Our Themes include the popular PaperLantern Default Themes (except Retro), some additional ones that were introduced at the beggining of cPanel X3 deprecation, and some custom ones designed for VistaPanel specifically.

## What vPanel Is?

vPanel (VistaPanel) is a control panel designed by iFastNet for their free hosting servers. It allows the owner of free hosting to control and manage their website easily through vPanel.

## Examples

We will soon make a demo link for our themes.
